## Description

This project is mainly for speed and learning on a personnal project.

### Features

* Classic token authentication
* Refresh token authentication
* OAuth2.0 Authentication (Not really but soon)

### Built with

- Markdown
- Rust
    - serde
    - artix web

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Dependencies not explicitly covered in the installation process; e.g., OS restrictions.
- Cargo
- Rust 
 
Both of them are obtainable via ![rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Usage

`cargo build`

or

`cargo run`

will both do the trick. The idea is to just get the server running. 
The Api description will come at a later date for better usage.
